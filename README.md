Repository containing all the software needed for the ENAS research

The goal of this repository is to be able to take the following 3 models:
* DHDN
* DIDN
* GRDN

and perturb their network hyperparameters in a "intelligent" way.

This repository will contain the following modules:
* utils - module containing helper functions
* controller - module containing a controller which can output hyperparameters for networks
* DHDN
* DIDN
* GRDN

# SIDD Dataset
The SIDD Dataset is a dataset comprising cellphone pictures taken at different lighting levels with different cell
phones. They are often in a folder detailing the device and lighting taken and come in two pairs of the following:
* Ground Truth
* Noisy
The images vary in dimension but are at least of size 1080p. 

# TODO: Explain what each parameter in Training section of config does.
