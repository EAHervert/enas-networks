Repository containing all the software needed for the ENAS research

The goal of this repository is to be able to take the following 3 models:
* DHDN
* DIDN
* GRDN

and perturb their network hyperparameters in a "intelligent" way.

This repository will contain the following modules:
* utils - module containing helper functions
* controller - module containing a controller which can output hyperparameters for networks
* DHDN
* DIDN
* GRDN
